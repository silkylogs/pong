# Pong
A very rough, yet barely playable implementation of pong made using raylib

## Compilation instructions
Run `make`. Seriously. Thats it.

## Supported platforms
For now only windows is the main target. However only a minor amount of tweaking
(namely the makefile) is required to port this game to any target currently supported by raylib.
